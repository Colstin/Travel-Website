# Travel Website

** Version 1.0.0 **

- This is a Simple Font-End project I made to practice using GitHub and HMTL AND CSS and show casing some basic website user response using Flexbox. 
- This Project is a Mock Travel Website showcasing some example hotel and other services this company can provide. It also links to different employees showing their profiles for you to be able to connect with.
